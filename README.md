1) Download pythia from https://www.pythia.org/.
2) Generate pp collision events from pythia.
3) Reconstruct jet using jet algorithms.
4) Apply different ML algorithms to classify the reconstructed jets.
5) Find the best ML model with accuracy score, comfusion matrix, f1 score etc.
6) Optimize the model by varying different parameters.

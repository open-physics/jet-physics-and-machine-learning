## Charm-Jet Physics with Machine Learning

#### Short description
This project aims to measure charm jets in proton--proton collisions using various hadronic interaction models like PYTHIA.
The analysis will also be performed on open data from the ALICE experiment.

#### How to find charm jets
Jets will be reconstructed from charged particles using the anti-kt algorithm.
Charm jets will be identified by the presence of a D0 meson as a constituent in each jet.
